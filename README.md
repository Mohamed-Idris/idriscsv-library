idriscsv is a Java library featuring list-based and two-way object bindable CSV data manipulation. List-based means, unlike the several other libraries which are using array-based implementations, this library uses list-based implementation. Two-way object binding means the library provides binding from CSV data to Java objects and vice versa, so as to facilitate the  conversion between the two representations.
